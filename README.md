# port-scanner
This Python-based port scanner is a simple yet effective tool for identifying open network ports on a target system or network.
It allows users to specify a target IP address or hostname and scan a range of ports to determine which services are actively listening. 
Created this in Cyber Defense Club.

How to use:
Go to terminal and run the program.
Make sure to include target website URL or IP address.
Will take around 5 minutes to scan.

Only use on websites with proper authorization.
